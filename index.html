                    Hello, I'm Adam. I'm a London (UK) based, aspiring Game Developer and Level Designer. I have significant experience with industry-standard game engines such as Unity and Unreal, along with thousands of hours of proficiency in 3D art software like Blender and Substance Painter.
                </b>
                <br>
                Alongside my professional goals, I have a strong passion for mod creation. My journey began with childhood experiences playing Pokemon on the DS and evolved as I delved into modding Skyrim on my old Sony laptop back in 2013. This sparked my interest in creating mods, leading me to contribute as a Level Designer for the modding team Beyond Skyrim at the age of 14.
                <br>
                <br>
                One of my most notable projects, "Badly Translated Skyrim," gained significant online attention with over 3 million views across multiple YouTube videos and received positive feedback. Currently, I am working on "Fallout Skyrim," a personal passion project merging two of my favorite games, Fallout and Skyrim, with the aim of creating a unique gaming experience.

                Though I have yet to release a game, I have dedicated substantial time to recreating systems from games I've enjoyed using engines like Unity and Unreal.
                <br>
                My first significant project in Unity involved recreating Minecraft's world generation system. While the outcome didn't match the performance and robustness of Minecraft's, 
                the experience proved invaluable in advancing my proficiency in C# and 3D game development. Especially in threading, optimization, and procedural generation techniques.
                <br>
                <br>
                Since them I have continued to advance my knowledge in C#, Unity and Game Development.

            <p>
                I'm primarily trained in Front-End Web Development. I was trained by OpenClassrooms and their partnership with AMS and taught how to use 
                HTML, CSS and SASS to their full capabilities.
            <br><br>
                Since then I've further developed my skills in Front-End development, learning Javascript, and delved into back end in order to create this website.
                I've setup a framework on this site to automatically load any json files I have and read the data to generate the showcase elements seen in the other tabs.
                It'll also dynamically find pictures of specified file types and allow anyone to cycle through those images with the hierachy shown below.

            <p>
                I am far from an expert at Web development but I plan on expanding this website until I feel I've learned all I can from it. If you would like to discuss
                or request my web development abilities please get in touch with the contact button on the header.
