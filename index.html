                I am a London (UK) based, aspiring Game Developer and Level Designer with thousands of hours of experience in Industry standard game engines, such as Unity and Unreal, 
                and over 3 thousand hours in 3d Art software, such as Blender and Substance Painter.

                I also have a hobby and passion for Mods and Mod creation.
                My love for gaming started with Pokemon on the DS and has just kept growing since. It soared when I first downloaded Skyrim on my old Sony laptop to download mods back in 2013, 
                since then I have been fascinated with creating my own mods. I started out at 14 years old as a Level Designer for the large, semi-professional modding team Beyond Skyrim,
                with this fascination eventually turning into a passion for game development.
                <br>

                My most successful project (Badly Translated Skyrim) garnered a lot of attention online, with over 3 million views across multiple youtube videos, and a very positive reception.
                While that mod is mostly complete, my current modding project, Fallout Skyrim, is a spare time passion project and an attempt to merge 2 of my favourite games (Fallout and Skyrim) 
                with the result hopefully ending in a completely new game.

                Though I have yet to release a game I've made, I have spent a lot of time recreating systems from other games that I've enjoyed in engines like Unity and Unreal.
                My first large project in Unity was a recreation of Minecrafts world generation. Though the result wasn't as performant and robust as Minecrafts, 
                it taught me a lot about C# and 3D game development in general. Especially understanding threading, optimisation and procedural generation.
