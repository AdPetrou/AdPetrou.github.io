    "paragraph": "Nothing special, just a cute farm I put together for my mobile game while testing a new asset pack. The first picture is the intended, fixed view of the game (though its slightly zoomed out in the picture) with there being nothing more out of camera view, to optimise the game as much as possible, especially for mobile.<br><br> This level was more of a concept to the game so I could get a better picture and visually see my goal. The actual game will have the player building their own farm and it won't be prebuilt like this. <br><br>Eventually there will be shops on the street just outside the farm for the player to sell their goods and to buy new tools, seeds and more.",
